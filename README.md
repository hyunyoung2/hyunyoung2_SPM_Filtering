# SPAM Text Filtering

This repository is the result of my research with google's c code about word2vec, SVM Light and Neural Network. 

 
- SVM_Light_data.py : data creation for SVM_light engine into SVM_light of data dir 

- integration_of_docs.py : In order to integrate into a set of data together such as spm and ham data 
- sen2vec.py : In order to make a sentence vector with word2vec

- word2vec.sh : This is used to make word2vec from my raw text data using google's word2vec engine

- feedforward_NN_layer\* : This is used to run spam filter using neural network on tensorflow
